The original data is a liitle bit large, so we didn't includ it in our folder.
If you want to run the data_processing.py, please go the website to download the raw data.

The files are:
train.csv - the training data (you are encouraged to join in many more useful external datasets)
test.csv - the dates to predict; there is a week of overlap with the training data for the initial Public leaderboard. Once submissions are paused, the Public leaderboard will update based on last 28 days of predicted data.
submission.csv - a sample submission in the correct format; again, predictions should be daily
